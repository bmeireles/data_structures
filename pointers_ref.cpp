//Pointers and references

//A pointer is a variable which value is a memory address
//Adresses can be the location in memory of a variable or function
//If a variable x has as value the address of a variable y, we say:
//" x points to y"
//the address of a variable is the location in memory of the first byte occupied by it.
//We can create complex structures if we know the address of a variable (linked lists)
//Working directly with memory enables the programmer to create more efficient code!
